# CiteWinder
A Java tool to help link up JabRef and Obsidian. A personal project that might turn out helpful for someone else someday.

## AI Usage
I'm using this project as a testground for trying out AI pair programming, so portions of this code are generated by JetBrains AI and Copilot.

## Setup
Coming soon - executable jar. Currently, built on Windows with Microsoft OpenJDK 21.
